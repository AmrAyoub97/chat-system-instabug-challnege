# Instabug Backend Challenge

### Description
Itâ€™s required to build a chat system. The system should allow creating new applications where
each application will have a token(generated by the system) and a name(provided by the client).
The token is the identifier that devices use to send chats to that application.

### Tech Used
* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) - Ruby is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language
* [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) - A web-application framework that includes everything needed to create database-backed web applications
* [MySql](https://www.mysql.com/) - MySQL is an open-source relational database management system
* [Elasticsearh](https://www.elastic.co/) - Elasticsearch is a search engine, provides a distributed, multitenant-capable full-text search engine
* [Redis](https://redis.io/) - Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker.
* [Sidekiq](https://sidekiq.org/) - efficient background processing for Ruby
* [JWT](https://jwt.io/) - JSON WEB TOKENS allows you to decode, verify and generate tokens.

### System Features
Create, Update and Read (applications, chats, messages), through the endpoints.

### Requirments
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
